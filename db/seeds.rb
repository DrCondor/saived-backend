# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Admin users are created manually via the admin panel or Rails console.
# See AdminUser::ALLOWED_EMAILS for the list of allowed admin emails in production.
